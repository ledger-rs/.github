# Rusty Ledger

Hi and welcome to the Ledger-rs project!

# Purpose

This organization is created for the purpose of facilitating activities in creating a [Ledger](https://ledger-cli.org/)-compatible implementation in Rust programming language. This may include a Ledger rewrite or a completely new system.

Please note that this is a very early stage in the project initiation.

# Background

The original idea was expressed in a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/comments/yrit29/ledgercompatible_implementation_in_rust/) in [Plain Text Accounting](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/) channel on Reddit and in the related discussion.
The [poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/comments/zjtz9x/interested_in_contributing_to_ledger_port_to_rust/) ensued afterwards, illustrating higher than expected interest in a project of this sort.

While the initial idea was to create a Ledger-compatible implementation in Rust. Due to Rust's rising popularity, it might be a good point in time to gather people who might want to learn and use Rust and, at the same time, blow some new winds into Ledger-cli, creating new features, fixing existing issues, etc.

One of the original proposals in the above-mentioned conversations was a full rewrite of Ledger.

# Onboarding

The participation is open for everyone! If you are interested in the project, please join in the activities.

The focus area at the moment is the Discussions section. It is intended for collaboration of interested individuals on all aspects of the project.
The main repository is [Incubator](https://github.com/ledger-rs/incubator), which hosts the Discussions. 

The Wiki section contains some static references and is useful as a notepad for now.

Additional repositories will be created for different purposes, as needed.

# Impressum

Ledger is the initial program applying the [Plain-Text Accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) principles.

The (temporary) logo uses [Rust logo](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/logo-policy-and-media-guide/) with modifications, to indicate a personal finance application Ledger, implemented in Rust programming language.
