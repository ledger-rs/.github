# Rusty Ledger

Hi and welcome to the Ledger-in-Rust project!

# Purpose

This organization is created for the purpose of facilitating activities in creating a [Ledger](https://ledger-cli.org/)-compatible implementation in Rust programming language. This may result in a Ledger rewrite or a completely new system. This will depend on the directions chosen by the community. Please note that this is still a very early stage of the project initiation.

# Background

The original idea was expressed in a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/comments/yrit29/ledgercompatible_implementation_in_rust/) in [Plain Text Accounting](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/) channel on Reddit and in the related discussion.
The [poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/comments/zjtz9x/interested_in_contributing_to_ledger_port_to_rust/) ensued afterwards, illustrating higher than expected interest in a project of this sort.

The initial idea was to create a Ledger-compatible implementation in Rust. Due to Rust's rapidly-rising popularity, this might be a good point in time to gather people who want to learn and use Rust and, at the same time, blow some fresh wind into Ledger-cli, creating new features, fixing existing issues, etc.

One of the proposals expressed in the above-mentioned conversations was a full rewrite of Ledger. Others suggested a new implementation.

The authors of existing (known) Ledger-like implementations in Rust were contacted and invited to join the efforts.

# Onboarding

The participation is open for everyone! If you are interested in the project, please join the activities in any way you find suitable.

The focus area at the moment is the Discussions section, which is intended for collaboration on all aspects of the project.
The main repository is [Incubator](https://github.com/ledger-rs/incubator), which hosts the Discussions. 

The Wiki section contains some static references and is useful as a notepad for now.

Additional repositories are created or added for different purposes, as needed. Some existing implementations have joined the ranks and may be useful in the coming stages of the project.

This is a place where we all act civil and respect others' points of view. The goal is for the project to provide value to all involved.

# Workflow

The Open Questions category contains the issues that require group collaboration and some sort of agreement before the decision is made and real work should follow. The idea is to measure three times and cut once, as the saying goes. The general idea in regards to the decisions is similar to the [RFC process](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/) that Rust organization is using. The point behind being to encourage community feedback on ideas and proposals.

Polls should be activated where a simple vote count is needed. Normally, once several options are identified in a discussion, it can be put to a vote. The poll options can not be modified without resetting the votes so it is recommended to thoroughly discuss a topic in a separate thread first.

The general workflow proposal is outlined in https://github.com/ledger-rs/ledger-cli-rs/discussions/24.

# Impressum

Ledger is the initial program applying the [Plain-Text Accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) principles.

[Plain-Text Accounting channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/) on Reddit is one of the locations where interactions on the topic of PTA take place.

The (temporary) logo uses [Rust logo](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/logo-policy-and-media-guide/) with modifications, to indicate a personal finance application Ledger, implemented in Rust programming language.
